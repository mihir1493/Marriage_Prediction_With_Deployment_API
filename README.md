1. NoteBook - Marriage Age Prediction : Contains the importing the dataset, cleaning the data, performing EDA, Modelling using Ensemble models and Exporting the Model.
2. Building and hosting a web app using Flask, Flasgger and Swagger as Frontend.
3. File with the code values for each feature value is given in text file
